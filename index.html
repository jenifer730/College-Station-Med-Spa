        </ul>

        <h2>Popular Treatments Available</h2>
        <p>Among the most requested services at College Station med spas are:</p>
        <h3>Botox and Fillers</h3>
        <p>Botox is used to temporarily smooth wrinkles, especially around the forehead and eyes, while dermal fillers restore lost volume in areas like cheeks and lips.</p>

        <h3>Laser Treatments</h3>
        <p>Advanced laser technology helps remove unwanted hair, reduce pigmentation, and improve skin texture. These treatments are effective and offer minimal downtime.</p>

        <h3>Microneedling and PRP</h3>
        <p>Microneedling stimulates collagen production, reducing the appearance of fine lines, scars, and enlarged pores. When combined with PRP (platelet-rich plasma), the results are even more dramatic.</p>

        <h3>HydraFacial</h3>
        <p>This multi-step treatment cleanses, exfoliates, and hydrates the skin, leaving it radiant and youthful. HydraFacials are suitable for all skin types and are great before special occasions.</p>
